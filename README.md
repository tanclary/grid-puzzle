i recently found this little 4x4 puzzle in the back
of an airplane seat. i think it is for unaccompanied
minors to pass the time. while neither a minor nor 
unaccompanied, i have been playing with it a lot
since i found it. i thought trying to program it would
be a fun and easy challenge. maybe i'll add improvements, maybe not.

basically, you shuffle the grid and using the one
blank space, move the tiles (by clicking) around until
they are sorted in ascending order. the original puzzle
that i found had a picture of a penguin but this would
have made debugging much harder.
